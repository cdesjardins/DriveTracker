DriveTracker
============
Is a simple android program that allows you to track your mileage, which I used for tax purposes.

When you drive somewhere you pull up DriveTracker on your phone and enter the current odometer reading.

The drive tracker will then create a new entry on your google calendar with your current location (from GPS),
current time, and of course the mileage you just entered.
